This project simulates populations and samples from normal, gamma, and Poisson bivariate distributions with a specified correlation structure to evaluate the performance of several Randomized Response Technique (RRT) mean estimators. For each distribution, a population is generated, a random sample is drawn, and the scrambling variable 𝑆∼𝑁(0, 2^2)  is added to form the reported response. Key parameters (means, variances, correlations, coefficients of variation, and derived values θ,ϕ) are computed, and four estimators (Ordinary Mean, Ratio Estimator I, Exponential Ratio Estimator II, and Estimator III) are evaluated in terms of estimate, bias, mean squared error (MSE), and percent relative efficiency (PRE). The R code automates the entire process and exports the population, sample, parameters, and estimator results for all three distributions into a single Excel file for comparison and analysis.
